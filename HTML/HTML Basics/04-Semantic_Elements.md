# What are Semantic Elements in HTML?

Semantic elements in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning. These elements provide structure and improve accessibility, making web pages more understandable to both developers and search engines.

### Key Points:
- **Semantic elements** clearly describe their content (e.g., `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
- They help improve SEO by providing context and meaning.
- They enhance accessibility by making it easier for screen readers to interpret the content.

### Examples of Semantic Elements:

1. **`<header>`**: Represents the header of a section or page (usually contains a logo, navigation, etc.).
   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>Website Title</h1>
       <nav>
           <ul>
               <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
           </ul>
       </nav>
   </header>
