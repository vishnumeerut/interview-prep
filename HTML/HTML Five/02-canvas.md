# What is the Use of the `<canvas>` Element?

The `<canvas>` element in HTML is used to draw graphics, such as images, shapes, and animations, directly in the web browser. It is a versatile element that can be manipulated using JavaScript, allowing for dynamic, scriptable rendering.

### Key Features:
- The `<canvas>` element provides a blank space on the webpage that can be drawn on using JavaScript.
- It is often used for creating 2D and 3D graphics, game graphics, data visualizations, and interactive animations.
- The canvas is a low-level API, meaning it requires JavaScript to interact with and render content.

### Basic Syntax:
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
