# Whatâ€™s New in HTML5?

HTML5 introduced several new features, elements, and APIs to improve the functionality, structure, and multimedia capabilities of web pages. These updates aim to make websites more interactive, accessible, and mobile-friendly.

### Key New Features in HTML5:

1. **New Semantic Elements:**
   - **`<article>`**, **`<section>`**, **`<nav>`**, **`<header>`**, **`<footer>`**, and **`<aside>`** provide more meaningful structure to web pages and improve accessibility.

2. **Multimedia Support:**
   - **`<audio>`** and **`<video>`** elements allow easy embedding of audio and video without needing third-party plugins like Flash.
   ```html
   <audio controls>
       <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
   </audio>

   <video controls>
       <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </video>
