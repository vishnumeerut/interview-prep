## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Singleton Pattern

Ensures a class has only one instance.

```js
const Singleton = (function () {
  let instance;

  function createInstance() {
    return { name: "I am the instance" };
  }

  return {
    getInstance: function () {
      if (!instance) {
        instance = createInstance();
      }
      return instance;
    }
  };
})();

const obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true
