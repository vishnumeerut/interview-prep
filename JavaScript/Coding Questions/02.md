Imagine you are working on an online education platform where users can create custom quizzes. The platform requires a frontend component that allows users to input quiz questions and answers dynamically. 
Your task is to design a simple form validation system using JavaScript that ensures all required fields (question, answer1, answer2) are filled before submission. Additionally, if the user attempts to submit the form with empty inputs, display an error message indicating which fields need completion.
Once fully validated, append the new quiz entry as a list item on the screen below the form. More specifically, include 'Question' as an input field and 'Answer 1', 'Answer 2' as two separate input fields along
with a submit button labeled "Add Quiz". 
Use your understanding of DOM manipulation to accomplish this
in pure JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks.
